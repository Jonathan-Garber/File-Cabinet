== Using Video Templates ==
Video Templates are simple text files that contain the html you wish to use for displaying your video embeds.


YouTube Videos will use the file youtube_template.txt
Vimeo Videos will use the file vimeo_template.txt

Your custom templates should go into the following folder
/wp-content/uploads/file-cabinet-templates

You can use the following template codes to insert information about the video and the video itself.

{title} - This will display the Title of the video you entered when adding it to your file cabinet

{description} - This will display the description you entered about the video when you added it to the file cabinet

{width} - This will display the width of the video you entered when adding it to the file cabinet

{height} - This will display the height of the video you entered when adding it to the file cabinet

{video} - This will insert the proper Iframe for the video.

Please see the default video template located in the plugins "templates" folder for an example of how to use custom templates.
